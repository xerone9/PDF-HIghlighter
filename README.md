# PDF-HIghlighter

If you have so many values to highlight in the PDF file. The software will search the values supplied to it and then will highlight it for you.

Suppose you are working on a PDF file that has 100s of pages and you want to highlight not one but multiple values so the normal practice is to open the file and Press CTRL + F, Enter the value and press enter and highlight and keep pressing enter and highlight manually for one value where is the application will find and add annotation (Highlights) automatically for you

It has 2 options Discussed Below

Option 1 – PDF Highlighter

How To Use

Create a text file and add values in it you want to highlight. Every single value must be separated by a line space (Enter). Open the software and add the text file and then add the PDF file on which you want to highlight the values. Only first color can be selected from below options. If you have more then one word then the second color will be a random color selected automatically.
At the end the output log will appears that shows you how much values are found, how many are repeated values, how many values are not found.
Make sure the files (text and PDF) are not empty and PDF is not password protected

Option 2 – PDF Highlighter and Extractor

How To Use

This option is mostly for accounts purpose (record keeping). Suppose you have a bank statement that contains 100s of pages and contains 1000s of values. You need to find specific values present on what pages and you want to print only that page with a highlight for your record.
Create a text file and add values in it you want to find. Then add a PDF file. It will search for values and once the value is found only that page is extracted with a highlight. Suppose 2 values in the text file both appeared in one page of PDF file. That page will be copied 2 times. 1st comes with the first value highlight and the same page comes again with a second value highlight. Suppose there are 50 values and PDF have 1000 pages. The output file will show 50 pages. A single page has single highlight of the value

**NOTE: The application will not work for all PDFs due to multiple encodings (Already working on it). Worked for few files as tested and don’t use online2PDF for merging files. Due to some unknown reason files merged with online2PDf website becomes unreadable for the application
